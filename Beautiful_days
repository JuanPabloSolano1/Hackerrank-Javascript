Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number , its reverse is . Their difference is . The number  reversed is , and their difference is .

She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

Given a range of numbered days,  and a number , determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where  is evenly divisible by . If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Print the number of beautiful days in the range.



Solution: 
function beautifulDays(i, j, k) {
 let number = k
 let array = [i,j]
 let final_array = Array.from(Array(array[1] + 1).keys())
 let array_total = (final_array.slice(array[0]))
 let new_list =[]
 array_total.map(element =>{
   let check = () => element.toString().split("").reverse().join("") * Math.sign(element)
   if(((element - check(element))/number) % 1 == 0){
     new_list.push(element)
   }
 })
 return(new_list.length)
}
beautifulDays(20,23,6)
